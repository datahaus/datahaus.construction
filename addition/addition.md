# Master and Attic Addtion

## Phase 6 - Framework, Roof, Insulation, Windows, Siding

<!--
	Expanded polystyrene (the white insulation made up of a lot of small beads bonded together) has an insulating value of 4 per inch thickness. Thus, if you used three one inch polystyrene boards together to make a wall that is 3 inches thick, the R value would be about 12, roughly 3 times better insulating than wood
