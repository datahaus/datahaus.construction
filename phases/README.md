### Low Carbon Emission Concrete

Atlanta-based Thomas Concrete has been using the Canadian CarbonCure system since 2016.
[CNN Article](https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/12/technology/concrete-carboncure/index.html)  

"CarbonCure involves injecting carbon dioxide captured from various other industrial processes into concrete during the mixing process. A chemical reaction would “mineralize” that carbon dioxide, which would have the added benefit of making the concrete compressively stronger." “We have seen no downsides to using CarbonCure,”  Drew Millwood, the Thomas Concrete technician who oversaw the Kendeda job, writes: “It allows for cement reduction in any mix it is used in and provides strength at or above design. No cost increase is involved in a mix containing CO2 as the savings from cement reduction offset the cost of CO2 delivery. Equipment costs are easily recouped due to the savings.” - [source](https://livingbuilding.kendedafund.org/2019/07/16/carboncure/)  


## Move Electric Box

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| Move the exterior electric box to the side of new porch.<br>Move mosition of wire from pole to the left so it will reside within future wall. | $800 | $2,000 |

After new roof is completed, include a metal ring on wire to prevent squirrels from crossing to house.


## Hollow Core Slab (aka Coreslab)

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| **Hollow core install** | | |
| Hollow core slabs, lifted into place by crane on truck | $15,000 | $25,000 |
| Weatherproof plywood cover over basement stair opening, secure from below. Hinges on east side for access to basement stairway. | $100 | $400 |

<br>

<a href="../phases/img/coreslab.jpg"><img src="../phases/img/coreslab.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width:1200px"></a>
<br><br>


8” slab + 2” concrete topping. 10” total.  

Hollow Core slabs and basement floor will provide a heat-sink in the main floor, storing heat generated from solar energy to radiate out at night.  

Electric heating will reside within basement floor to heat basement ceiling slab from below.

### Concrete with Cellulose Nanocrystals

Cellulose nanocrystals provide an avenue for water to hydrate cement particles when mixing.  

Cellulose-infused concrete is stronger and sets faster

| &nbsp; | | |

<br><br>

Waterflow at porch - Six levels of drain protection:

1. Area above stairs drains into pipe that outputs below porch.  
2. Downspout drains into three rain barrels within west side of porch, then outputs below porch.  
3. Sidewalk above stairs drains to outflow below porch.  
4. Sidewalk below stairs has a drain before doorway. Addition to sidewalk angles away from door.  
5. Goove below doors drains below porch.  
6. Interior floor angles away from deeper basement, which has a sump pump.

## STEP Warmfloor

We will probably implement basement floor heatsink during ongoing projects to coincide with solar panels:  

STEP Warmfloor gives 2.5 times more heat output than cable systems, 2.08 times more heat output than hydronic systems, and up to 60% more efficient than conventional forced air systems.  

[https://www.warmfloor.com/green-technology/sustainable-technology/](https://www.warmfloor.com/green-technology/sustainable-technology/)

It could be placed under wood to create our gym-livingroom floor, rather than pouring more concrete on the hollow core slabs for hydronics. A thermal barrier between the basement slab and the element would add efficiency for a basement install. In the livingroom we would heat the slab during the day to radiate throughout the night, so no thermal barrier would be used under the livinging room floor surface.  

[https://youtu.be/q2c8cLrZYkc?t=184](https://youtu.be/q2c8cLrZYkc?t=184)

A thermal barrier between the slab and the element adds efficiency
