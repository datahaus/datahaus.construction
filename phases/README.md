## Remove plaster and wood slats in downstairs kitchen

Loren will do the following:  

Remove plaster/slats from ceiling in both kitchens. Leave kitchen pantry areas which contain water heater and water/gas supply pipes. Before removal, create envelope of plastic within room to prevent any dust from moving into house or falling between floor boards. Remove old pipes from within south wall. Remove in upstairs kitchen first. Tie slats in bundles to prevent puncturing contrator bags.<br>DO NOT remove either side of exterior two walls on both levels.<br>Carefully remove and retain door trim from interior walls. Also retain molding for reuse.
